# Applied-Crypto
Lab work and coursework code for the Applied Cryptography unit  undertook in my third year at the University of Bristol.

The coursework was to implement AES on bespoke hardware, then perform an attack on the AES scheme we imlpemented to retrieve the 
private key using oscilloscope data, and finally securing our AES implementation against such an attack and discussing why our
prevention method would be successful.
