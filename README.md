# Applied-Crypto
Lab work and coursework for the Applied Cryptography unit undertook in my third year at the University of Bristol. Grade achieved - 

The coursework was to implement AES on bespoke hardware, then perform a DPA attack on the AES scheme we imlpemented to retrieve the 
private key using data collected from an oscilloscope. Finally, we secured our AES implementation against such an attack using techniques such as shuffling and random operation injection and discussing why our prevention method would be successful.
