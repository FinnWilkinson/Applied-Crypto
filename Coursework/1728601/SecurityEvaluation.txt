 - Randomly inserts exactly 48 dummy operations during each of the main 9 AES loops and in the final loop.
 - dummy operations consist of extra SubByte, ShiftRow, AddRoundKey, and MixColumn function calls
 - uses scale_tsc() multiplied with a random byte of the input randomness in order to seed the random numbers generated
 - random number generator seeded after each dummy operation

 - in the function aes_enc_rnd_sub (subBytes step), the order that sbox is applied is determined randomly by first seeding the srand once again, and then
   using rand() to generate the order that sbox is called upon each byte of the current state

 - combining shuffling on the sbox calculations, and adding in dummy operations imporves the security at little additional compuational and space costs.
